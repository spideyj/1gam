You arrive home after a long and tiring day, only to realize that there is a long and tiring pile of household chores ahead of you.

:: Stacking Dishes

You approach the dishes to stack them into some semblence of order before you begin washing them, but you realize before long that you need to take the garbage out first. Various food cartons and other remnants of past hurried meals are deposited amongst the dishes, and you have no hope of organizing any of this without disposing of the detritus first.

:: Taking Out the Garbage
You pull the overstuffed garbage bag out of the garbage can, nearly ripping it in the process. As you lift the unwieldy thing, a hole rips in the side, spilling some of the contents.

:: Another garbage bag
You set the groaning bag down and go to the cupboard to get out an empty one. The box of garbage bags is nearly empty, though; if you use one to enclose the other, you won't have a bag to replace it in the garbage can.
